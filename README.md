# Auto heel toe

Auto heel and toe downshifting with arduino.

A servo motor is used to operate the throttle and simulate the "pedal blip".

Intended to become something like this http://auto-blip.com/.

The basic idea is that you have one switch for the clutch and one switch for the brake pedal.

When both these pedals are pressed, the servo motor is activated in order to open the throttle.

Here is the wiring:
